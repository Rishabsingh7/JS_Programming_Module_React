/**
Array Some And Every Function

Some Function: syntax:- array.some(callback function)

They return either true or false value from the callback function.
When they return true value if any one of element of array satisfied.
the condition of a call back function first time then they return true otherwise
check for every element of array and return false.

Every Function: This is exactly opposite of some function 
                They check the the condition of call back function on every element of 
                array and if it is not satisfied by any one of element then immediately
                they return false otherwise they apply the condition on every element
                then finally return true value.
